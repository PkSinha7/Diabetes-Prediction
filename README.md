# Diabetes-Prediction
Developed a Diabetes Prediction Machine Learning model utilizing the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier algorithm to
accurately classify diabetes cases based on a range of input features.

Conducted thorough data preprocessing techniques, ensuring optimal data quality and compatibility with the SVM model.
Implemented a train-test split methodology to evaluate the performance of the SVM model, achieving high accuracy and
demonstrating the effectiveness of the developed solution in predicting diabetes cases.
